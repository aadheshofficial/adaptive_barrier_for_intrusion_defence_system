        "    - Open recursion (DNS amplification attacks - dns-recursion).\n"
        "    - Cache snooping to check if domains were previously resolved (dns-cache-snoop).\n"
        "    - DNSSEC weaknesses and record enumeration (dns-nsec-enum).\n"
        "    - Weak transaction ID and source port randomization (dns-random-srcport, dns-random-txid).\n"
        "    - Brute-force subdomain enumeration (dns-brute).\n"
        "    - Service discovery through DNS (dns-service-discovery).\n"
